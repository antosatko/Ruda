# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There are currently no versions to support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Ruda was created as a learning project and was never intended to be used in production. As such, there are no plans to support it in the future. Security concerns can therefore be discussed in the issues section of this repository. This way, other users can be warned of potential security issues.

If you still want to contact me directly, you can do so via email [danikantos@gmail.com](mailto:danikantos@gmail.com).

Keep your code safe and happy coding!

# Ruda

Ruda is a general purpose programming language that aims to be as straightforward as possible.

Extra focus is put on the following:

- **Simplicity**: Ruda is designed to be easy to learn and use. It has a simple syntax and a small number of keywords.
- **Safety**: Ruda is a statically typed language. It also has a built-in garbage collector that allows you to take charge of memory management if needed.
- **Flexibility**: Ruda is a multiparadigm language that allows you to write code in a functional, imperative or object-oriented style. Or maybe a mix of all three.

# Hi

If you are still figuring out how all the programming stuff works, then this is a great time to take a deep breath and relax. You have come a long way and you deserve a break.

The best way to learn is to build something. I have prepared a beginner friendly project that you can try out [here](/projects/number-guessing-game) when you are ready.

## What's next?

In the next section we will learn about Advanced topics in Ruda.

You will learn everything there is to know about writing Ruda programs.
